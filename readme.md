# Laravel With Keygen Demo Code

**You can checkout the complete tutorial on Scotch: [Laravel Random Keys with Keygen](https://scotch.io/tutorials/laravel-random-keys-with-keygen).**

This project contains a demo code showing how to use the PHP [Keygen](https://github.com/gladchinda/keygen-php) package in a Laravel application. It is required that [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/installation) and the [Keygen](https://github.com/gladchinda/keygen-php) package be installed before cloning the repository and trying out the demo.

It is also required that you install the missing dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) before you continue. Make sure you have the correct configuration in your `.env` file.

```shell
composer install
```
